##Categorize a list of numbers into even or odd

#Requirments:
-Ensure Dart SDK is installed.

#How does it work:
1- It loops arround the list using for loop and checks for each number if it is divisble by 2 or not.
2- In case the number is divisible by 2 then it will print number is even.
3- In case it is not divisble by 2 then it will print the number is odd.

#Additional:
Another way to do it using for-each loop with terrnary opperator to check if the number is divisble by 2 or not
